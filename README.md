# ACMPractice-C-
This is a daily ACM C++ practice. 
Since August last year (2019), I started this practice to familiarise myself in C++. 
Although I am still new to it, hopefully I will improve, better and better. 
I think my solutions to the questions may not be the best way, but it definitely works and forms a basic root of the questions. 
Hence, I have to thanks my friends, Kessie in the same department in helping me to figure out and work together.

In every folder, the source.cpp is the C++ code I implement as the solution, whilst the pdf is the description of the problem
